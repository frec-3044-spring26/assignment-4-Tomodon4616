## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
library(ratdat)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
complete_old |> 
  summarize(hindfoot_mean = mean(hindfoot_length, na.rm = TRUE),
            hindfoot_max = max(hindfoot_length, na.rm = TRUE),
            count = n(), .by = c("species", "plot_type"))
#same as using group_by

```

```{r}

my_vec <- c(2, 6, 12, 24, 32)

my_vec[3]

my_vec[c(1, 5)]

my_vec[1:4]

i <- 2

my_vec[i]

my_vec * 10  #vectorized operations

```

```{r}
my_mat <- matrix(data = 100, nrow = 3, ncol = 4)

my_mat[2, 3] #not like python :(

my_mat[8] #counts from top to bottom, then left to right

my_mat[] #everything


array(100, dim = c(2, 3, 4, 2)) #generalized form of n dimensional objects 


complete_old[1, ]
```


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
